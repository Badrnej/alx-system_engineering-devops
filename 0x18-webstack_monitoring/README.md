# Web Stack Monitoring

## Background Context

“You cannot fix or improve what you cannot measure” is a famous saying in the Tech industry. In the age of data-ism, monitoring how our software systems are performing is crucial. This project involves implementing one of the many tools to measure the activity on our servers.

Web stack monitoring can be broken down into two categories:

1. **Application monitoring**: Gathering data about your running software and ensuring it behaves as expected.
2. **Server monitoring**: Gathering data about your virtual or physical server and ensuring they are not overloaded (CPU, memory, disk, or network overload).

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts without the help of Google:

### General
- Why monitoring is necessary
- The two main areas of monitoring
- Access logs for a web server (such as Nginx)
- Error logs for a web server (such as Nginx)

## Requirements

### General
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All your files will be interpreted on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
- All your files should end with a new line
- A `README.md` file at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
- All your Bash script files must be executable
- Your Bash script must pass `Shellcheck` (version 0.3.7) without any error
- The first line of all your Bash scripts should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/env bash`
- The second line of all your Bash scripts should be a comment explaining what the script is doing
