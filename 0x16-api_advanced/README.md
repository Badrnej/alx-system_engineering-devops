# API Practice with the Reddit API

## Background Context

Questions involving APIs are common in technical interviews. Sometimes they’re as simple as 'write a Python script that queries a given endpoint,' while other times they require more complex tasks such as using recursive functions and formatting or sorting the results.

A great API to use for practice is the Reddit API. With numerous endpoints available, many that don’t require any form of authentication, there's a wealth of information to parse and present. Getting comfortable with API calls now can be beneficial during technical interviews and in personal projects.

## Resources

Read or watch:

- [Reddit API Documentation](https://www.reddit.com/dev/api/)
- [Query String](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string)

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts without the help of Google:

### General
- How to read API documentation to find the endpoints you’re looking for
- How to use an API with pagination
- How to parse JSON results from an API
- How to make a recursive API call
- How to sort a dictionary by value

## Requirements

### General
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3 (version 3.4.3)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- Libraries imported in your Python files must be organized in alphabetical order
- A `README.md` file at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
- Your code should use the PEP 8 style
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`
- All your modules should have documentation (use `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'` to check)
- You must use the Requests module for sending HTTP requests to the Reddit API
