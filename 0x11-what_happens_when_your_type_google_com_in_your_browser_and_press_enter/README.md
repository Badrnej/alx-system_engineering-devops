# Software System Infrastructure Overview

## Background Context
Being a Full-Stack Software Engineer means you’re comfortable interacting with any layer of the stack. A way to easily assess this is to simply ask an engineer to explain how a software system works. They can have a general overview of the flow or can choose to dig deep in a certain area. Let’s practice by exploring the infrastructure side (network, servers, security…) of the question.

## Overview
This project aims to provide an overview of how a software system works from an infrastructure perspective. It will cover key components such as DNS requests, TCP/IP, Firewalls, HTTPS/SSL, Load Balancers, Web Servers, Application Servers, and Databases.

## Requirements
- Post your blog post on the platform of your choice, LinkedIn or Medium are good ones.
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory.
